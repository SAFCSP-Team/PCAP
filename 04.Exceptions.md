# Exceptions
Each time your code tries to do something wrong or something it can't handle (like dividing by zero, accessing a non-existent file, or calling a function incorrectly),  Python does two things:

1. Stops execution at the error.
2. Creates a special kind of data, called an exception, to describe the error.

This process is called **raising an exception**. If you don't handle the exception, Python will terminate your program and display feedback.

```python
import math

x = float(input("Enter x: "))
y = math.sqrt(x)

print("The square root of", x, "equals to", y)
```
> [!WARNING]
> The user may enter a string that can't be converted to a float, or a negative value that makes the sqrt() function fail.

**Possible error messages:**
```
Enter x: Abc

Traceback (most recent call last):

  File "sqrt.py", line 3, in <module>

    x = float(input("Enter x: "))

ValueError: could not convert string to float: 'Abc'
```
```
Enter x: -1

Traceback (most recent call last):

  File "sqrt.py", line 4, in <module>

    y = math.sqrt(x)

ValueError: math domain error
```
> [!NOTE]
> `The ValueError` is the name of the exception.

## Handling Exceptions
Let's take a look at the division example :

```python
first_number = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
second_number = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

print(first_number/second_number)

print("THE END.")
```
If the user enters 0 as the second number, they will get:
```
Enter the first number: 5
Enter the second number: 0
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "main.py", line 4, in <module>
    print(first_number/second_number)
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
```
### Pre-Checking Input
Let’s check the second value before dividing: 
```python
first_number = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
second_number = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

if second_number != 0:
    print(first_number / second_number)
else:
    print("This operation cannot be done.")

print("THE END.")
```
While this works, Python provides a more flexible and powerful way to handle errors: **exception handling with `try` and `except` blocks.**

## The `try`-`except` Statement
The syntax of using the try-except statement
```python
# The code that always runs smoothly.
try:
    # Risky code.
except:
    # The place where the handling of the exception

# Back to normal.
```
Write the risky code in a try block and handle exceptions in one or more except blocks.
```python
first_number = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
second_number = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

try:
    print(first_number / second_number)
except:
    print("You cannot divide by zero.")

print("THE END.")
```
- The code in the try block is executed.
- If an exception occurs, Python stops execution of the try block and looks for a matching except block.

### Generic `except`
If you use an `except:`, without an exception name, it will catch **all exceptions**, but it's best practice to catch specific exceptions when possible to avoid hiding unexpected bugs.
```python
first_number = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
second_number = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

try:
    print(first_number / second_number)
except Exception: # handles any exception
    print("An unexpected error occurred.")

print("THE END.")
```

## Multiple exceptions 
If you need to handle more than one exception coming from the same try branch, you can add more than one except branch, and you should consider the following:
- You must not use more than one except branch with a certain exception name.
- The first matching except block will execute, so the other branches will not be visited.
- If an unnamed (general) except branch exists, it has to be specified as the last.
- You cannot add more than one unnamed except.
```python
try:
    x = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    y = 1 / x
    print(y)
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("You cannot divide by zero, sorry.")
except ValueError:
    print("You must enter an integer value.")
except:
    print("something went wrong...")

print("THE END.")
```
You can catch multiple exceptions together: 
```python
try:
    num_list = [10, 20, 0, 'thirty']
    for num in num_list:
        result = 100 / num
except (ZeroDivisionError, TypeError):
    print("Error: Division by zero or invalid type detected.")
```
## The `else` and `finally` Blocks
Else: If there is no exception, then this block will be executed.

Finally: the Finally block always gets executed, whether an exception is generated or not.
```python
try:
    x = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    result = 10 / x

except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Error: Division by zero!")

except ValueError:
    print("Error: Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.")

else:
    print("Division result:", result)

finally:
    print("End of exception handling.")
```

**Output examples:**

- Valid input:
```
Enter a number: 2
Division result: 5.0
End of exception handling.
```
- Division by zero:
```
Enter a number: 0
Error: Division by zero!
End of exception handling.
```
- Invalid input:
```
Enter a number: abc
Error: Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.
End of exception handling.
```

## Exception Hierarchy
Python 3 defines 63 built-in exceptions. Some of the built-in exceptions are more general they include other exceptions, while others are completely concrete they represent themselves only. 

Python exceptions are organized into a class hierarchy. 
(image)
Let's begin examining the ZeroDivisionError.
- ZeroDivisionError is a special case of a more general exception class named ArithmeticError;
- ArithmeticError is a special case of a more general exception class named  Exception.
- Exception is a special case of a more general class named BaseException.
```python
try:
    y = 1 / 0
except ArithmeticError:
    print("Arithmetic problem!")
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Zero Division!")

print("THE END.")
```
Output:
```
Arithmetic problem!
THE END.
```
Because `ArithmeticError` is more general and is listed first.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> - The matching branch doesn't have to specify the same exception exactly - it's enough that the exception is more general (more abstract) than the raised one.
> - The order of the branches matters!
> - Don't put more general exceptions before more concrete ones; this will make the latter one unreachable and useless.


## Common Built-in Exceptions

**1. BaseException**  
**Location:** `BaseException`  
**Description:**  The root of Python’s exception hierarchy. All built-in and user-defined exceptions inherit from this class, either directly or indirectly. Using `except:` or `except BaseException:` will catch all exceptions, including system-exiting exceptions like `SystemExit` and `KeyboardInterrupt`. Typically, you should use `except Exception:` to avoid unintentionally catching system-exiting exceptions.

**2. KeyboardInterrupt**  
**Location:** `BaseException` → `KeyboardInterrupt`  
**Description:**  Raised when the user interrupts program execution, usually by pressing <kbd>Ctrl+C</kbd> (or <kbd>Ctrl+Break</kbd>) in the terminal. If this exception is handled and not allowed to propagate, the program continues running. Otherwise, it terminates.

**3. MemoryError**  
**Location:** `BaseException` → `Exception` → `MemoryError`  
**Description:**  Raised when an operation runs out of memory and cannot allocate the required resources. This is typically encountered with very large data structures or excessive memory use.

**4. ImportError**  
**Location:** `BaseException` → `Exception` → `ImportError`  
**Description:**  Raised when an `import` statement fails to find the module definition or when a `from ... import ...` fails to find the specified name in the module.

**5. AssertionError**  
**Location:** `BaseException` → `Exception` → `AssertionError`  
**Description:**  Raised when an `assert` statement fails, i.e., its expression evaluates to `False`, `None`, `0`, or an empty sequence/object.

**6. LookupError**  
**Location:** `BaseException` → `Exception` → `LookupError`  
**Description:**  An abstract base class for exceptions raised when a lookup on a collection (such as a list, dictionary, or tuple) fails. Subclasses include `IndexError` and `KeyError`.

**7. IndexError**  
**Location:** `BaseException` → `Exception` → `LookupError` → `IndexError`  
**Description:**  Raised when a sequence subscript is out of range (for example, trying to access an element at an index that does not exist in a list or tuple).

**8. KeyError**  
**Location:** `BaseException` → `Exception` → `LookupError` → `KeyError`  
**Description:**  Raised when a mapping (dictionary) key is not found in the set of existing keys.

**9. ValueError**  
**Location:** `BaseException` → `Exception` → `ValueError`  
**Description:**  Raised when a built-in operation or function receives an argument of the correct data type but an inappropriate value.  
**Examples:**  
- Calling `int('abc')` raises a `ValueError` because `'abc'` cannot be converted to an integer.  
- Providing a negative number to `math.sqrt()` raises a `ValueError` because the square root of a negative number is not defined for real numbers.

**10. ArithmeticError**  
**Location:** `BaseException` → `Exception` → `ArithmeticError`  
**Description:**  An abstract base class for errors occurring in numeric calculations. Subclasses include `ZeroDivisionError`, `OverflowError`, and `FloatingPointError`.

**11. OverflowError**  
**Location:** `BaseException` → `Exception` → `ArithmeticError` → `OverflowError`  
**Description:**  Raised when the result of an arithmetic operation is too large to be represented (e.g., when a float calculation exceeds the maximum representable value).

**12. ZeroDivisionError**  
**Location:** `BaseException` → `Exception` → `ArithmeticError` → `ZeroDivisionError`  
**Description:**  Raised when the second argument of a division or modulo operation is zero.  


**For a complete list, see the [official Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html).**

## Raising Exceptions Manually

The raise keyword is used to raise exceptions or errors during the execution of a program. When you raise an exception using raise, you specify the type of exception to be raised and, optionally, a message that provides more information about the error.
```python
raise Exception
```
Raise a ValueError : 
```python
x = -5
if x < 0:
    raise ValueError
```
Output:
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<main.py>", line 3, in <module>
ValueError
```
The syntax for using raise with a message:
```python
raise ExceptionType("Optional message describing the error")
```
Raise a ValueError with a custom message:
```python 
x = -5
if x < 0:
    raise ValueError("x should be a positive number")
```
**Re-raising an exception:**

Inside an `except` block, you can use `raise` without arguments to re-raise the current exception:
```python
raise
```
This kind of raise instruction may be used inside the except branch only; using it in any other context causes an error.

```python
def bad_fun(n):
    try:
        return n / 0
    except:
        print("I did it again!")
        raise

try:
    bad_fun(9)
except ArithmeticError:
    print("I see!")
```
Output:
```
I did it again!
I see!
```
The ZeroDivisionError is raised twice:

First, inside the try part of the code (this is caused by actual zero division)

Second, inside the except part by the raise instruction.

## Using `assert` Statements
The `assert` statement is a debugging aid that tests a condition. If the condition is false, it raises an `AssertionError`.
```python
assert expression
```
How does it work?
1. It evaluates the expression.
2. If the expression evaluates to True, or a non-zero numerical value, or a non-empty string, or any other value other than None, it won't do anything else.
3. Otherwise, it automatically and immediately raises an exception named AssertionError (in this case, we say that the assertion has failed)

```python
import math

x = float(input("Enter a number: "))
assert x >= 0.0
x = math.sqrt(x)
print(x)
```

Input < 0 (e.g., Entering -5):
```
Enter a number: -5
AssertionError
```
The syntax for using assert with a message:
```
assert condition, message
```
```python
import math

x = float(input("Enter a number: "))
assert x >= 0.0 ,"the input should be  larger than or equal to 0" 
x = math.sqrt(x)
print(x)
```
Input < 0 (e.g., Entering -5):
```
Enter a number: -5
AssertionError: the input should be larger than or equal to 0
```

## Accessing Exception Details (`as` keyword)
The `as` keyword is used to assign the caught exception to a variable. This variable (`e`) allows you to access information about the exception that was raised. You can then use this variable to handle the exception or extract specific details about the error.
```python
try:
    numbers = [1, 2, 3]
    index = 3
    raise IndexError("Index out of range:", index)
except IndexError as e:
    print("IndexError Message:", e)
    print("Arguments Passed with Exception:", e.args)
```
Output:
```
IndexError Message: ('Index out of range:', 3)
Arguments Passed with Exception: ('Index out of range:', 3)
```

## Exceptions accept arguments
Some of the exceptions accept arguments to provide additional context or information about the error condition.

**Examples:**

1. **ValueError**:
The ValueError exception can take an argument to provide details about the invalid value that caused the error.
```python
try:
    x = "abc"
    raise ValueError("Invalid value:", x)
except ValueError as e:
    print("ValueError Message:", e)
    print("Argument Passed with Exception:", e.args)
```

2. **TypeError**:
The TypeError exception can take an argument to indicate the type mismatch that caused the error.
```python
try:
    x = "abc"
    raise TypeError("Invalid type:", type(x))
except TypeError as e:
    print("TypeError Message:", e)
    print("Argument Passed with Exception:", e.args)
```
3. **IndexError**:
The IndexError exception can take an argument to specify the index that caused the out-of-range error.
```python
try:
    numbers = [1, 2, 3]
    index = 3
    raise IndexError("Index out of range:", index)
except IndexError as e:
    print("IndexError Message:", e)
    print("Argument Passed with Exception:", e.args)
```
## Defining Custom Exceptions
Users can create custom exceptions by defining new exception classes and raising them in specific error scenarios. These custom exceptions are useful for handling unique error conditions and improving the error-handling features of Python programs.

**Steps to Create and Use User-Defined Exceptions**
1. Define a New Exception Class: Create a new class that inherits from Exception or any of its subclasses.
2. Raise the Exception: Use the raise statement to raise the user-defined exception when a specific condition occurs.
3. Handle the Exception: Use try-except blocks to handle the user-defined exception.
```python
# Step 1: Subclass the Exception class
class InvalidAgeError(Exception):
    def __init__(self, age, msg="Age must be between 0 and 120", error_code=1001):
        # Custom attributes
        self.age = age
        self.msg = msg
        self.error_code = error_code
        super().__init__(self.msg)  # Call the base class constructor

    def __str__(self):
        return f"[Error Code {self.error_code}] {self.age} -> {self.msg}"

# Step 2: Raising the custom exception
def set_age(age):
    if age < 0 or age > 120:
        raise InvalidAgeError(age)
    else:
        print(f"Age set to: {age}")


# Step 3: Handling the custom exception 
try:
    set_age(150)  # This will raise the custom exception
except InvalidAgeError as e:
    print(e)
```

Output: 
```
[Error Code 1001] 150 -> Age must be between 0 and 120
```
